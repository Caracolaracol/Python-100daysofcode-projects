# #TODO-1 - Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word.
# import random
# chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)

# #TODO-2 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.
# guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

# #TODO-3 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word.

# for letter in chosen_word:
#     if letter == guess:
#         print('letter guessed!')
#     else: 
#         print('bad guess!')


# #Step 2

# #Testing code
# print(f'Pssst, the solution is {chosen_word}.')

# #TODO-1: - Create an empty List called display.
# #For each letter in the chosen_word, add a "_" to 'display'.
# #So if the chosen_word was "apple", display should be ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_"] with 5 "_" representing each letter to guess.

# guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()
# largopalabra = len(chosen_word)

#         display[n] = chosen_word[n]
#     else: 
#         display[n] = "_"

# #TODO-2: - Loop through each position in the chosen_word;
# #If the letter at that position matches 'guess' then reveal that letter in the display at that position.
# #e.g. If the user guessed "p" and the chosen word was "apple", then display should be ["_", "p", "p", "_", "_"].
# for letter in chosen_word:
#     if letter == guess:
#         print("Right")
#     else:
#         print("Wrong")

# #TODO-3: - Print 'display' and you should see the guessed letter in the correct position and every other letter replace with "_".
# #Hint - Don't worry about getting the user to guess the next letter. We'll tackle that in step 3.
